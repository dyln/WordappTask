## Task Definition
I want to build a mobile app that people can use so as to create blog posts and review comments regarding to posts. So my mobile app needs a rest API server to manage all stuff. 

## Functional Requirements:
* ~~I want to be able to sign up by email/password or Facebook~~ <br />
* I want to be able to sign in using access token (Oauth Authentication) <br />
* ~~I want to be able to create/update/delete posts;~~ <br />
* I want to be able to attach files to posts <br />
* ~~I want to be able to mark post as 'draft' (not public)~~ <br />
* ~~I want to be able to mark post as 'publish' (public)~~ <br />
* I want to be able to read/update/delete comments <br />
* I want to be able to mark comment as 'visible' (public) <br />
* I want to be able to mark comment as 'invisible' (not public) <br />

## Technical Requirements
* It should be a WEB application: <br />
    * For the server side you would use any technology that runs on Ubuntu server. <br />
* It should have server side validation; <br />
* It should have a user authentication solution. The user should only have access to his/her own posts and comments <br />
* It should have automated tests for all functionality (models, controllers, acceptance/functional tests); <br />
* The rest API server should have versioning. <br />
* Use GIT as a version control <br />
* Use SQLITE as database server <br />

## Installation & Documentation
* Your API server should run on any Ubuntu Server. <br />
* Your API server should not have complex dependency. <br />
* You should write clean documentation for installing the app and make it run. <br />
